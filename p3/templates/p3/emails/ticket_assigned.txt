{% load conference %}
Hi {{ name }},

{{ ticket.user.assopy_user.name }} has just assigned you an
admission ticket for the {{ conference }} conference!

{% if just_created %}
You must fill in your ticket by following this link:
{{ link }}

You can use the above link to directly access your ticket
and your just-created account on the EuroPython website.

We suggest that you add a social login to your account (through
Google, Facebook or other providers) so that you will be able
to login directly from the website, without having to search
this e-mail every time. Just go to your profile to do this:
{% url assopy-profile as u %}
{{ u|full_url }}

If you don't like social logins, you can instead choose a password,
so to be able to login through the standard login/password form:
{% url assopy-password-reset as u %}
{{ u|full_url }}

{% else %}
The ticket has been connected to your existing account, and you will be able to
see it in your profile.

You can also directly access your ticket using this link:
{{ link }}
{% endif %}

In case you face any difficulties, you can always write a mail to our
Support Team (europython-contact@python.org) or talk to the support
managers on the website live chat.

Thank you for your purchase.
Take care!
